# Endpoint Security

Fortinet Client

Fortinet XDR
Endpoint is the entry point to a network.
- Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) was intended to prevent file-based malware attacks and implements other preventative controls. It provides features like:
    * Antivires, 
    * Device Firewall 
    * Web Filtering, 
    * Encryption, 
    * Device control.
 - Endpoint Detection and Response ( EDR ) : is is design to ``Detect, Investigate and Response`` to suspicious activity on users endpoint devices.
 - Extended Detection and Response (XDR) : It combines AI and EDR to provide machine speed detection and response capabilities to secure not only endpoints, but also the network and access layer, and the cloud.
 - Ex in Fortinet, they have endpoint security client such as: FortiEDR & FortiClient

## Exam
### 1) Which type of malware makes signature-based antivurus ineffective ? 
- Signature-based, 
- Polimorphic, 
- File-based, 
- Click bait ?
Answer:
```diff
+ Polymorphic 
+ It malware makes signature-based antivirus ineffective because it constantly changes its code to evade detection by traditional signature-based antivirus solutions.
```

### 2) Identify two problems that are solved by having a single security agent on endpoints. (Choose two.)
Select one or more:
- Lack of integration between endpoint security products
- Lack of visibility into how many endpoints have not applied the latest security patches
- Multiple administration consoles adds complexity
- Some users visit dangerous websites
Answer:
```diff
+ Lack of integration between endpoint security products.
+ Multiple administration consoles adds complexity.
```

### 3) Why do threat actors target endpoints in a network?
Select one:
- They are an easy point of entry into a network.
- Endpoints have a greater monetary value than other assets, such as a database.
- Compromising endpoints offers a greater challenge.
- Antivirus software on endpoints is inferior to that on servers.
Answer:
```diff
+ They are an easy point of entry into a network.
```

### 4) Which type of malware seriously reduced the effectiveness of signature-based antivirus?
Select one:
- Social engineering
- Polymorphic
- Adware
- File-based
Answer:
```diff
+ Polymorphic.
```

### 5) Which service is used as part of endpoint detection and response (EDR)?
Select one:
- Forensics investigation tool
- Web filtering
- Device control
- Antivirus (AV)
Answer:
```diff
+ Forensics investigation tool.
```

### 6) Which description best identifies file-based malware?
Select one:

- A downloaded file, which when opened, runs malicious code or a script
- The use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information
- Exploits security loopholes and spreads only in the device memory
- A large number of irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent over the internet
Answer:
```diff
+ A downloaded file, which when opened, runs malicious code or a script.
```
