# Security Orchestration Automation and Response - SOAR)

SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It is a technology solution that helps organizations to automate and streamline their security operations. SOAR integrates with existing security tools and systems, collects data from various sources, and applies machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze and prioritize security incidents. SOAR then automates the response to these incidents, reducing response time and increasing the effectiveness of security teams. It also enables security teams to document their response and remediation actions, facilitating incident reporting and compliance.


### 1) What is alert fatigue?
Select one:
- Analysts reduce the number of alerts using SOAR
- The SOAR system is overloaded by the amount of network traffic
- Measures the time lag to resolve alerts
- Analysts are overwhelmed by the number of alerts
Answer:
```diff
+ Analysts are overwhelmed by the number of alerts.
```

### 2) Which statement best describes SOAR?
Select one:
- SOAR connects all security tools together into defined workflows that can be run automatically
- SOAR plays out potential cyberattacks to improve network security preparedness
- SOAR orients the security team by defining and categorizing cyberattacks
- SOAR collects logs from all security tools to improve network visibility
Answer:
```diff
+ SOAR connects all security tools together into defined workflows that can be run automatically.
```

### 3) Which is a benefit of SOAR?
Select one:
- It reports on which endpoints require patching and have security vulnerabilities
- It analyzes and generates a security score to measure improvements in network security
- It increases security team efficacy by automating repetitive processes
- It deflects DDoS attacks and identifies the Command and Control source
Answer:
```diff
+ It increases security team efficacy by automating repetitive processes.
```

### 4) What is a common use case for an implementation of SOAR by customers?
Select one:
- Logging events and alerts
- Detecting zero-day attacks
- Guarding against DoS attacks
- Phishing investigations
Answer:
```diff
+ Phishing investigations.
```

### 5) What are playbooks used for?
Select one:
- To plan a set of manual tasks to be completed by analysts
- To automate the actions that an analyst would typically do manually
- To provide a set of scenarios of predicted cyberattack methods
- To describe the order in which analysts complete tasks
Answer:
```diff
+ To automate the actions that an analyst would typically do manually.
```
