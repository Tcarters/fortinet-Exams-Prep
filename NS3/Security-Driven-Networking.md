# Security-Driven Networking
- It delivers Enterprise Protection and User Experience at Any Edge.
- Provides secure high-performance connectivity between:
  * Users
  * Applications
  * Devices.
  
 > The correct answer is (2) The integration of networking and security capabilities.
Security-driven networking is an approach to network design and implementation that prioritizes security as a core component. It involves the integration of networking and security capabilities to create a more holistic and cohesive approach to protecting the network and its assets.
> This approach recognizes that traditional networking and security solutions are often implemented as separate silos, which can result in gaps and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. By integrating networking and security capabilities, security-driven networking seeks to create a more seamless and comprehensive approach to security.

> Some of the key features of security-driven networking may include the use of software-defined networking (SDN) and network virtualization technologies to create more flexible and dynamic security policies. It may also involve the use of advanced threat detection and response capabilities, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to identify and respond to emerging threats in real-time.

> In summary, security-driven networking is focused on creating a more integrated and comprehensive approach to network security, by combining networking and security capabilities to create a more holistic approach to protecting the network and its assets.
  
  
 ## Digital Transformation
 The process of using digital technologies to create new-- or to modify existing -- organizational processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing requirements.
- Benefits of it:
  * Enhances the collection of customer data  
  * Uses resources more efficiently.

- It create new many netowrk Edges involving:
  * Inconsistent security
  * Unpredictable experience
  * Complex to manage
