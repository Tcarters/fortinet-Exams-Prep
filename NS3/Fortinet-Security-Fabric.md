It is a platform that addresses organizational cybersecurity challenges.
- Key Atributes are: Broad, Integrated, Automated.

- Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture ( CSMA )
> The Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture (CSMA) is a new approach to designing and implementing cybersecurity solutions. It is based on the concept of a "mesh" network, where multiple devices and endpoints are interconnected in a flexible and dynamic manner.
In a CSMA, security services are distributed across the network, with each endpoint responsible for its own security. This means that instead of relying on a central security point, the security functions are decentralized and distributed across the network. This can improve the resilience of the network, as a breach or failure of one endpoint does not necessarily compromise the security of the entire network.
CSMA also allows for a more flexible and adaptable approach to security. Endpoints can dynamically connect and disconnect from the network, and security policies can be applied on a per-endpoint basis. This allows for a more granular approach to security, where different endpoints can have different levels of access and security based on their specific needs.
Overall, the CSMA is seen as a promising approach to cybersecurity, particularly in the face of increasingly sophisticated and persistent cyber threats. It offers a more flexible and adaptable approach to security that can better accommodate the evolving needs of modern networks.



## Security Fabric Pillars :
- Security-Driven Networking converges networking and security into a single, integrated system.
- Zero Trust Access (ZTA)
- Adaptive Cloud Security provides cloud native security with auto-scaling across and within multi-cloud environments.
- Security Operations/ Fabric Management Center enables centralized management, network automation and orchestration and analytics.
