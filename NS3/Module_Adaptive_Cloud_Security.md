# Adaptive Cloud Security

## The 3 principales  values are:
- Native integration
- Broad protection
- Management and automation

### Native Integration
It include :
- Fabric connectors
- Optimization
- Automation for Cloud resource abstraction
- High availability
- Auto-scaling

### Broad Protection
It includes features :
- Zero-day threat protection
- Application control
- Secure SD-WAN
- Zero trust
- Web application firewall
- Email security


### Management and Automation
- Visibility : through helps of FortiCNP
- Control : through helps of FortiAnalyzer
- Policy :  through helps of FortiManager
- Compliance
- Security and threat research : through helps of FortiGuard Labs
