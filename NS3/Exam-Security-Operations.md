### Knowledge Check
**FortiSIEM vs FortiAnalyzer**

You should consider deploying FortiSIEM for a mature SOC with multi-vendor environment.
- FortiAnalyzer is the entry level log collection for FOrtinet devices, and is deal for beginner level SOC.
- As more devices are onboarded FortiSIEM can collect thousands of logs per second, analyze them and generates incidents. FortiSIEM can also mitigate incidents but FOrtiAnalyzer cannot.
