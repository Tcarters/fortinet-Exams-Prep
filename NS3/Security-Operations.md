## Lesson1 - FortiNDR
- It is a device that uses artificial intelligence and other analytics to identify suspicious activities, covering both network traffic and file-based analysis, and adaptively containing threats while protecting the network from new threats.
- It stands for **Network Detection and Response **
- FortiNDR was formally known as **FortiAI**
- It capabilities :
  * Virtual Security Analyst
  * Detect
  * Trace
  * Respond

### Pain Points for Organizations

- Ai is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. It includes
  * Machine Learning
  * Artificial Neural Networks
  * Deep Neural Networks
 
 ### ML Traffic Anomalies Detection
 - Profiles the traffic and features:
   * Geo IP
   * User behavior
   * IPs 
   * Ports
   * Example of a feature is unsual destination traffic
   * Tracks false positives and negatives
